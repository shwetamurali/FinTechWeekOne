# (3) Write a program to print the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.  (4) Write a program that finds all the prime numbers less than a given number n.  EXTRA CHALLENGE VERSION: How efficiently can you make this program run?  (5) Write a square root calculator.

#(1) Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except: if it's a multiple of 3, it prints "fizz" instead, and if it's a multiple of 5 it prints "buzz" instead.  And for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "fizzbuzz."   #DONE
# for i in range(1,101):
#     if(i%3==0 and i%5==0):
#         print("fizzbuzz")
#     elif(i%3==0):
#         print("fizz")
#     elif(i%5==0):
#         print("buzz")
#     else:
#         print(i)
        
#1a make the program print "fizz" for numbers that contain the digit 3 (and the same for buzz and digit 5, and fizzbuzz for both digits 3 and 5). #DONE
# for i in range(1,101):
#     if("5" in str(i) and "3" in str(i)):
#         print("fizzbuzz")
#     elif("3" in str(i)):
#         print("fizz")
#     elif("5" in str(i)):
#         print("buzz")
#     else:
#         print(i)

#(2) Write a program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
